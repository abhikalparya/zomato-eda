# EDA on Zomata Bangalore Restaurants
New restaurants are opening every day. However it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and over-licensing. This Zomato data aims at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place.
